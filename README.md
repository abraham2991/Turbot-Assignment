# Turbot-Assignment

Login to the AWS account and secure your user
- To secure user, its best practice to change the password and enable MFA. I was able to enable MFA but I am unable to change the password for this account




Use Terraform to create a network in AWSâ€™s us-west-2 region:
Delete the default VPC in that region - Terraform adopted the default VPC provisioned by AWS which means Terraform can't handle the deletion of the default VPC
Create a VPC + 2 Subnets in different availability zones, Create an Internet gateway attached to the VPC, Create a security group that allows ingress from your IP address on port 22 and allows egress to the internet (0.0.0.0/0) on port 443. - All resources were created using Terraform. I made use of Variables too to make the code more reusable, flexible, and maintainable. 






# Fork the turbot/tdk repo
Add a top level folder named customer_success_test
In that folder create a python script list_user_policies.py
That script should iterate over all users in the account, listing the iam policies attached to each user.
Create a pull request for your fork






Create a compute resource:
Deploy a linux based t3.micro EC2 instance into the VPC created above
Clone the forked repo to the instance, run your python code
Stop the EC2 instance
